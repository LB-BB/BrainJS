Networks are composed of layers:

-Input layer
-Hidden layers
-Output layer

Brain.js basically describes the input and output layers for you, but you can decide how many hidden layers you want. That's where the changes happen. If we were talking about a human brain, hidden layers are "where the ideas are". 

const net = new brain.NeuralNetwork({ hiddenLayers: [3] });
//the [3] indicates three neurons in one layer, not 3 layers.
//more layers would look like:
const net = new brain.NeuralNetwork({ hiddenLayers: [2, 2] });

The more hidden layers, the longer it takes to train.
