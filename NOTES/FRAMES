You can conceive of each neuron like the frame of a movie. Each movie frame is the same size. 

height + width = frame
frame = constant size

The frames, added together, are called the DEPTH.
frames = depth
depth = context

context will repeat and this context is known as RECURRENT. 

A single movie frame out of context is difficult to understand. 
But if you look at a series of frames, you may be able to predict what the next frame will look like. 
This is essentially what we are asking the computer to do. Continue a pattern over time!
