Problem: we want to throw a ball that hits a goal.

What goes into throwing a ball into a goal?

We'll need to know:

-The location of the goal
-the location of the ball
-how far the ball needs to go
-how much energy to put behind it

Making this prediction is FORWARD PROPAGATION.

Once we see the outcome, we can see how far we were off from our actual goal. 
Measuring that difference is Step 1 of BACK PROPAGATION. 
Step 2 is considering what we will do next. 

Then we will throw the ball again (propagate).
And re-measure (backpropagate).

The measurement itself is referred to as ERROR. 
You can log out the error using a log function. 

This process is what goes into the Brain method, train.
